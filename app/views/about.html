<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>A fractal is a complex shade with similar shape repeated infinitely. There are many ways to draw them. This app uses a replacement alogirthm. For each iteration, every line segment is replaced by a smaller version of the original shape.</p>
<p>On the grid you can create the orignal shape. On the output graph you can drag and zoom to examine the fractal in more detail. We cannot fully draw the full infinitude of a fractal, but we can get an approximation.</p>
